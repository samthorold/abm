description: Review a module implementing a paper from the prior-art/ directory

Your task is to review a module implementing a paper from the prior-art/ directory.

Apply critical thinking and reason from first principles to appraise the implementation.

Pay close attention to the stated goals of the paper vs the outputs of the implementation.

Favour fewer agents over many - look out for instances where agents might exist purely to keep track of state
and suggest how Agent state might be used instead.

If the outputs do not provide sufficient evidence to form an opinion, that is feedback in itself.

Review the implementation and provide suggestions for improvements in a markdown file inside the module.
