description: Implement a paper from the prior-art/ directory

Your task is to implement a research paper following instructions in the prior-art/ directory.

Use first principles and use pseudo-code in the prior art as a guide rather than something follow precisely.

Use tests and expected outcomes to iteratively confirm the paper is being implemented correctly.
Planning a testing strategy will be important to support this.

Use clippy and other rust tools to help you.

Implement the paper in prior art that seems closest to the description: $ARGUMENTS

If you think the paper has already been implemented, say so and stop.
