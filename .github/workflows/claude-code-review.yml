            Review this PR with focus on Agent-Based Model (ABM) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) implementation quality:

            # Domain-Specific Review Criteria

            ## 1. Research Translation Fidelity
            - Does the implementation accurately reflect the paper's stated goals and key findings?
            - Are the observable behaviors (via Stats) consistent with expected outcomes from the paper?
            - If prior-art/ summary exists, does implementation align with experiment setup described?

            ## 2. DES Framework Usage
            - Event/Agent/Stats architecture: Are Event enums well-designed? Do agents properly implement the Agent trait?
            - Agent behavior: Is event scheduling logic sound? Are time semantics respected (discrete usize time)?
            - Stats as observable state: Do Stats types expose both current state AND cumulative metrics?
            - Testing through Stats: Are tests verifying behavior through Stats interface, not internal state?

            ## 3. Agent Design Quality
            - Agent count: Are there fewer agents rather than many? Look for agents that exist purely to track state.
            - State management: Could Agent internal state replace unnecessary helper agents?
            - Behavior complexity: Are agent decision-making processes clear and aligned with research model?

            ## 4. Observability & Verification
            - Do Stats provide sufficient evidence to verify the implementation matches paper expectations?
            - Can key findings from the research be observed through the Stats interface?
            - Are tests using Stats projections to validate behavior (not testing implementation details)?

            ## 5. Code Quality (Lower Priority)
            - Rust idioms and clippy compliance (mention only if critically impacting simulation correctness)
            - Generic code style issues should be deprioritized in favor of domain concerns above

            # What NOT to Focus On
            - Generic code review comments (formatting, naming) unless they obscure simulation logic
            - Performance optimizations unless they affect simulation correctness
            - Documentation style (focus on whether Stats/Events are self-explanatory)

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
